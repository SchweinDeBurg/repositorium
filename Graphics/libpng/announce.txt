Changes since the last public release (1.2.40):

version 1.2.41 [December 3, 2009]

  Moved redundant IHDR checking into new png_check_IHDR() in png.c
    and report all errors found in the IHDR data.
  Eliminated useless call to png_check_cHRM() from pngset.c
  Expanded TAB characters in pngrtran.c
  Added "xcode" project similar one already in libpng-1.4.0beta (Alam Arias).
  Eliminated a shadowed declaration of "pp" in png_handle_sPLT().
  Revised pngconf.h to make it easier to enable iTXt support.  From libpng
    version 1.2.9 through 1.2.40, defining PNG_iTXt_SUPPORTED did not work
    as expected.
  Converted all PNG_NO_* tests to PNG_*_SUPPORTED everywhere except pngconf.h
  Changed many "#if defined(x)" to "#ifdef x" and fixed some indentation.
  Added png_calloc() as a non-exported function.
  Relocated png_do_chop() ahead of building gamma tables in pngrtran.c
    This avoids building 16-bit gamma tables unnecessarily.
  Removed a harmless extra png_set_invert_alpha() from pngwrite.c
  Bugfixes and improvements to CMakeLists.txt (Philip Lowman)
  Moved CMakeLists.txt from scripts into the main libpng directory.
  Patched ltmain.sh for wince support.
  Added PNG_CONVERT_tIME_SUPPORTED macro.
  Make inclusion of time.h in pngconf.h depend on PNG_CONVERT_tIME_SUPPORTED
  Updated scripts/pngw32.def and projects/wince/png32ce.def
  Copied projects/wince/png32ce.def to the scripts directory.
  Added scripts/makefile.cegcc
  Added PNG_DEPSTRUCT, PNG_DEPRECATED, PNG_USE_RESULT, PNG_NORETURN, and
    PNG_ALLOCATED macros to detect deprecated direct access to the
    png_struct or info_struct members and other deprecated usage in
    applications (John Bowler).
  Removed three direct references to read_info_ptr members in pngtest.c
    that were detected by the new PNG_DEPSTRUCT macro.
  Marked deprecated function prototypes with PNG_DEPRECATED.
  Marked memory allocation function prototypes with PNG_ALLOCATED.
  Changed png_check_sig() to !png_sig_cmp() in contrib programs.
  Corrected the png_get_IHDR() call in contrib/gregbook/readpng2.c
  Marked nonexported functions with PNG_PRIVATE macro.
  Revised scripts/*.def to reflect functions actually exported by libpng.
  Updated the copyright year in scripts/pngw32.rc from 2004 to 2009.
  Moved descriptions of makefiles and other scripts out of INSTALL into
    scripts/README.txt
  Rebuilt the configure scripts with autoconf-2.65
  Disabled the new pedantic warnings about deprecated function use and
    deprecated structure access unless the user defines PNG_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS.
  Added "#define PNG_NO_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS" in the libpng source files.
  Updated the list of files and made some cosmetic changes in README.
