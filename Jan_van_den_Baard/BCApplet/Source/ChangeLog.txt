Version 2.0
==============================================================================
- Due to a harddisk crash I lost the complete change log (and then some...) of
  all previous versions. Therefore the new change log is for version 2.0 and
  up. (17-3-2002)
- Tweaked the treeview a bit. Added images to the entries and made it single
  expand. (17-3-2002)
- Added the "Visible whitespaces" option. (23-3-2002)
- When the the GetUserName() API fails during the determination of the 
  settings files to use the default files are used. (7-5-2002)
- The "key recorder" did not see all key combinations. (19-7-2002)
