            <p>
                WARNING:</p>
            <p>
                This program and library (attempts to) compress data by performing several non-trivial
                transformations on it. Unless you are 100% familiar with *all* the algorithms contained
                herein, and with the consequences of modifying them, you should NOT meddle with
                the compression or decompression machinery. Incorrect changes can and very likely
                *will* lead to disastrous loss of data.</p>
            <p>
                DISCLAIMER:</p>
            <p>
                I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM/LIBRARY,
                HOWSOEVER CAUSED.</p>
            <p>
                Every compression of a file implies an assumption that the compressed file can be
                decompressed to reproduce the original. Great efforts in design, coding and testing
                have been made to ensure that this program works correctly. However, the complexity
                of the algorithms, and, in particular, the presence of various special cases in
                the code which occur with very low but non-zero probability make it impossible to
                rule out the possibility of bugs remaining in the program. DO NOT COMPRESS ANY DATA
                WITH THIS PROGRAM UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER SMALL,
                THAT THE DATA WILL NOT BE RECOVERABLE.</p>
            <p>
                That is not to say this program is inherently unreliable. Indeed, I very much hope
                the opposite is true. bzip2/libbzip2 has been carefully constructed and extensively
                tested.</p>
            <p>
                PATENTS:</p>
            <p>
                To the best of my knowledge, bzip2/libbzip2 does not use any patented algorithms.
                However, I do not have the resources to carry out a patent search. Therefore I cannot
                give any guarantee of the above statement.
