An English version of the GNU GPL is in the gpl.txt file distributed with

Distributing ZipArchive under GNU GPL implies ZipArchive can only be used 
with software that is licensed under conditions compliant with the GPL. 
Embedding in proprietary software requires an alternative license.

Alternative license for use with proprietary software

If you want to distribute software in a commercial context that incorporates
ZipArchive and you do not want to meet the conditions of GNU GPL 
(e.g. an obligation to provide a customer with the source code of your 
software that uses the ZipArchive library), you need to acquire a commercial license. 
- The commercial license provides you with the same rights as the GNU GPL, but in 
addition allows you to embed ZipArchive library in proprietary software without 
affecting the copyright of this software (it removes the GNU GPL obligation 
to publish the source code)
- The license gives you royalty free distribution rights
- The license does not allow you to transfer these rights
- The license is granted per developer 
- You won't need to purchase an additional license for the future versions of the library

The commercial license is available free of charge for using ZipArchive library in:
- Freeware software (freeware is software that is available free of charge, but which is copyrighted by the developer, who retains the right to control its redistribution and to sell it in the future)
	- Excluded is software which has no practical usage without purchasing an additional product(s) from the same company (such as software associated with an equipment or service that the same company provides). It is considered in this case that the software is part of another, priced product and the software is not freeware. 
	- If you decide to sell the software in the future - you will need to purchase the commercial license for using the ZipArchive library, unless it is distributed in the shareware way - see below
- Software distributed in the Shareware way (Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs differ on details -- some request registration while others require it, some specify a maximum trial period. 
Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software and the copyright holder retains all rights, with the exception that copying and distributing the program for evaluation purposes is encouraged, subject to certain conditions. For example, some authors require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware. )
	- Excluded is software which price for a single copy is higher than the price of the ZipArchive library for a single developer.

Extended Licence for HBZLIB (library for zip compression in Harbour)
You can create proprietary software using hbzlib respecting the follow:
- ZipArchive library must be linked together with hbzlib
- you cannot use ZipArchive as a dynamic library (DLL), it must be linked staticaly with the software 
- the commercial license for ZipArchive is free of charge, but these grants are valid only if the whole application is written with Harbour

There is a fee for the commercial license for using the library in the software not falling into the mentioned categories.

It is recommended that you should print two copies of the commercial license 
document after you receive it, sign them and send by post. One copy, signed by the author will be sent back to you.
