<h2><strong>CScintillaCtrl, CScintillaView &amp; 
CScintillaDoc v1.26</strong></h2>

<h2><i>Freeware MFC wrapper classes for the Scintilla edit 
control</i></h2>

<p>These classes provides a MFC wrapping for the Scintilla edit control (<a href="http://www.scintilla.org">http://www.scintilla.org</a>). 
This control provides an open source cross platform edit control. Some of the 
features it provides include syntax colouring, call tips, brace highlighting, 
Styles, margins and markers to name but a few. The provided wrapper classes make 
it easier to include the control in MFC projects on Windows.</p>

<h2><strong><a name="Features"></a>Features</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Implements all the 
  functionality provided by Scintilla v2.22.</li>
  <li>The CScintillaCtrl wrapper class observes the same 
  semantics as the built in MFC &quot;CEdit&quot; wrapper class.</li>
  <li>Uses the direct access functions provided by scintilla 
  to improve performance. Multi threaded code can still use SendMessage by 
  specifying FALSE for the bDirect parameter in the wrapper methods of 
  CScintillaCtrl.</li>
  <li>The generation of the wrapper class methods are created 
  using a Windows script file &quot;ConvertScintillaiface.js&quot; included in the 
  download. This allows the class to be easily updated when new versions of 
  Scintilla are released.</li>
  <li>The CScintillaView and CScintillaDoc classes provide a 
  complete doc / view implementation which can be dropped into an existing 
  project instead of the built in MFC rich edit or edit control classes.</li>
  <li>Provides built in MFC persistence support.</li>
  <li>All notifications sent using WM_NOTIFY and 
  WM_COMMAND are mapped to easier to use C++ virtual functions in the view 
  wrapper class.</li>
  <li>The CScintillaView class provides a default folding 
  implementation.</li>
  <li>Includes full &quot;Find and Replace&quot; support including the 
  regular expression support provided by Scintilla. To achieve this a 
  &quot;CScintillaFindReplaceDlg&quot; class is implemented which derives from the 
  standard MFC &quot;CFindReplaceDialog&quot;.</li>
  <li>Includes a complete MFC printing implementation in 
  CScintillaView.</li>
  <li>Includes complete support for standard Page Setup 
  dialog and print margins.</li>
  <li>Includes a framework for Print headers and footers.</li>
  <li>Includes support for all the standard MFC menu items, 
  such as Cut, Copy, Paste etc.</li>
  <li>The sample app demonstrates how top level messages 
  should be forwarded to the Scintilla control.</li>
  <li>The sample app also demonstrates how you would
    implement autocompletion and call tips in your code.</li>
	<li>The classes hide the fact that Scintilla does not natively support 
	Windows Unicode (aka UTF16 or UCS-2). The way Scintilla supports Unicode is 
	through a UTF8 API. The &quot;CScintillaCtrl&quot; wrapper class looks after the 
	details of setting up the Unicode code page for Scintilla and the 
	translation to and from UTF8 strings. If you take a look at the &quot;ScintillaCtrl.h&quot; 
	header file, you will see a section which includes widechar string versions 
	of the functions in Scintilla which involves string parameters. These 
	widechar string functions are wrapped in a &quot;_UNICODE&quot; pre-processor 
	#ifdef. Internally, these functions perform the thunking required to map 
	between Windows Unicode and the UTF8 API of Scintilla. Please note that 
	to perform this thunking the code uses the UTF8 translation functionality 
	provided by the &quot;WideCharToMultiByte&quot; and &quot;MultiByteToWideChar&quot; Win32 API 
	calls. Please note that UTF8 support for these Win32 API calls is limited to 
	Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT 4.0 or later. This does mean that it is 
	not possible to use the wrapper classes for Unicode on Windows 95 (if you 
	were to arrange to use the Microsoft Layer for Unicode aka Unicows). This 
	should not be an inconvenience for many people. Also note that this new 
	functionality which was introduced in v1.15 in no way prevents the wrapper 
	classes from being fully used if you were to use them in non Unicode mode on 
	Windows 9x.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong><a name="Usage"></a>Usage</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>To use the class in your code simply include
    ScintillaCtrl.h and ScintillaCtrl.cpp in your project and #include 
  ScintillaCtrl.h in which ever of your modules needs
    to make calls to the class.</li>
  <li>If you want to use the document / view wrappers then 
  also include ScintillaDocView.h and ScintillaDocView.cpp in your project.</li>
	<li>As of v1.21, the classes are now designed for VC 2005 or later. 
	They will not compile on earlier releases of VC.</li>
  <li>Your code will need to include MFC either statically or dynamically.</li>
  <li>If you are linking to Scintilla dynamically, then you 
  should call &quot;LoadLibrary(_T(&quot;SciLexer.dll&quot;))&quot; in the start-up of your 
  application. If using the control by statically including the control code, 
  then you need to register the scintilla window class yourself.</li>
  <li>To see the class in action, have a look at the module
    &quot;ScintillaDemoView.cpp&quot; in the sample app provided.</li>
  <li>For further information on  developing with Scintilla and 
  the functionality it provides, please review the comprehensive documentation 
  on the Scintilla web site.</li>

<h2><strong><a name="History"></a>History</strong></h2>

<p><strong>V1.0 (18 March 2004)</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Initial public release.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.01 (18 March 2004)</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Updated the sample app's Find Next and Find Previous 
  marker functions. Now correctly goes to the next and previous markers when a 
  marker is on the current line.</li>
  <li>Updated the sample app's passing of messages to 
  Scintilla from the top level CMainFrame window.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.02 (6 June 2004)</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.61.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.03 (13 August 2004)</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Made all the remaining non virtual functions related to 
  Find and Replace in CScintillaView virtual.</li>
  <li>CScintillaView::TextNotFound function is now passed the 
  parameters used for the search. Thanks to Dmitry Naumov for this update.</li>
  <li>Removed the CScintillaView::OnTextNotFound function as 
  all the work for it is achieved using the TextNotFound function.</li>
  <li>Creation of the find / replace dialog now takes place 
  in a new virtual function &quot;CScintillaViewCreateFindReplaceDialog&quot;. Again 
  thanks to Dmitry Naumov for this update. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.04 (20 December 2004)</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.62.</li>
  <li>Sample app now includes a common control 6 manifest</li>
  <li>Sample app now includes an example of scintilla autocompletion. When you type                          "scintilla is " case insensitively a autocompletion list is displayed which allows                          "very cool", "easy" or "way cool!!" to be entered.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sample app now includes an example of scintilla calltips. Whenever you hover
    over text which is "author " case insensitively, a call tip with the text                          "PJ Naughter" is displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.05 (4 March 2005)</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Fix in CScintillaView::PrintPage which now sorts out the issue of print preview
    not working in the MFC doc / view wrappers for scintilla. Thanks to Frank Kiesel
    for reporting this fix.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>30 May 2005</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated the sample app to show how to handle cancel
    call tips if a view loses focus, is sized or moved. This is achieved by
    handling WM_ACTIVATE in the view class and WM_SIZE and WM_MOVE in the child
    frame class. Thanks to Markus Werle for spotting this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.06 (10 July 2005)</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Addition of a virtual function namely OnAutoCSelection which handles the
    SCN_AUTOCSELECTION notification message which was introduced in Scintilla v1.63.
    Thanks to Dan Petitt for suggesting this update.</li>
  <li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.64.</li>
  <li>A new boolean variable called &quot;m_bUseROFileAttributeDuringLoading&quot; has been added                          to CScintillaView. If this value is set then the code will check the read only file
    attribute of the file being loaded and if it is set, then the document is marked as
    read only by Scintilla. By doing this any attempts to modify the document will cause                          the OnModifyAttemptRO virtual function to be called. This allows you to prompt to                          make the file read write or to check out the file from a version control system.                          Thanks to Dan Petitt for suggesting this update.</li>
  <li>Demo app now demonstrates how to use the SCN_MODIFYATTEMPTRO notification.</li>
  <li>Fixed a number of warnings when the code is compiled
    using Visual Studio .NET 2003.</li>
  <li>SetSavePoint and SetReadOnly calls are now made in CScintillaDoc::OnSaveDocument
    instead of CScintillaView::Serialize. This ensures that the control is only reset
    upon a successful save.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.07 (3 January 2006)</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.67. New 
	messages wrapped include: SCI_MARKERADDSET, SCI_SETPASTECONVERTENDINGS, 
	SCI_GETPASTECONVERTENDINGS, SCI_SELECTIONDUPLICATE and 
	SCI_GETSTYLEBITSNEEDED.</li>
	<li>Updated copyright messages</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the separator line in the header 
	was not being drawn due to issues in the code which calculates the 
	coordinates. </li>
	<li>Added two member variables which decide whether 
	printer headers and footers should be printed (CScintillaView::m_bPrintHeader 
	and CScintillaView::m_bPrintFooter). You could of course achieve the same 
	result by deriving a class from CScintillaView and implementing empty 
	PrintHeader and PrinterFooter methods!!!. Thanks to Jason Elliott for 
	suggesting this update.</li>
	<li>Optimized the construction of member variables in 
	CScintillaView::CScintillaView and in 
	CScintillaFindReplaceDlg::CScintillaFindReplaceDlg.</li>
	<li>CScintillaView::OnReplaceAll sets the selection to 
	0,0 before doing text replacement. This ensures that all text in a document 
	is replaced. Also this function now does not bother calling TextNotFound at 
	the end of the function if replacements took place. Thanks to Jason Elliott 
	for this nice update. </li>
	<li>A parameter which indicates whether text is being 
	replaced or found is now sent to CScintillaView::TextNotFound.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.08 (6 January 2006)</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Removed some unnecessary code from CScintillaView::OnEndPrinting. Thanks 
	to Greg Smith for spotting this issue.</li>
	<li>Updated the documentation to use the same style as the web site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.09 (8 January 2006)</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Find / Replace dialog and associated state is now maintained outside of 
	CScintillaView. This means that if you have multiple CScintillaView's in 
	your app, that they share the one find / replace dialog which is the 
	standard type of UI you would normally expect for this. Thanks to Greg Smith 
	for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Find / replace dialog is now closed when the last CScintillaView is 
	destroyed. Thanks to Greg Smith for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.10 (16 January 2006)</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Removed an unused &quot;rSetup&quot; variable in CScintillaView::PrintPage</li>
	<li>Optimized code in CScintillaView::PrintPage and 
	CScintillaView::OnFilePageSetup which determines if metric or imperial 
	measurements are being used. Now a boolean member variable of CScintillaView 
	called m_bUsingMetric which by default picks up the control panel preference 
	is provided. This allows client code to change this value to customize how 
	measurements are specified. Thanks to Greg Smith for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a small typo in CScintillaView::PrintHeader and PrintFooter. Also 
	explicitly uses the TA_TOP flag in combination with TA_LEFT when setting 
	alignment settings for header and footer text. Again thanks to Greg Smith 
	for reporting this.</li>
	<li>Scintilla find / replace state is now stored in a standard global 
	variable instead of using the CProcessLocal template which it was using 
	previously. This is no longer required since it was used to provide Win32s 
	support for MFC on older versions of MFC. Since Win32s is no longer 
	supported by MFC, there is no need to use this mechanism any more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.11 (2 February 2006)</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Minor update to CScintillaView to allow deletion of text when there is 
	nothing selected. Thanks to Alexander Kirillov for reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.12 (14 March 2006)</strong> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.68. New messages wrapped 
	include: SCI_CALLTIPUSESTYLE, SCI_SETCARETLINEBACKALPHA and 
	SCI_GETCARETLINEBACKALPHA.</li>
	<li>Updated the internal function CScintillaView::SameAsSelected to support 
	regular expressions. Thanks to Greg Smith for this update.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.13 (22 May 2006)</strong> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed a flicker issue when the CScintillaView is resized. Thanks to Michael Gunlock 
	for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.14 (5 June 2006)</strong> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.69. New messages wrapped 
	include: SCI_MARKERSETALPHA, SCI_GETSELALPHA and SCI_SETSELALPHA.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.15 (6 June 2006)</strong> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated the wrapper classes to work correctly when compiled for Unicode.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.16 (29 June 2006)</strong> </p>

<ul>
  <li>Removed common control 6 manifest as this conflicts with VC 2005 
	compilation.</li>
	<li>Code now uses new C++ style casts rather than old style C casts where 
	necessary. </li>
	<li>Optimized CScintillaCtrl constructor code</li>
	<li>Updated the code to clean compile in VC 2005</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the sample program when you invoke Print Preview when 
	compiled using VC 2005.</li>
	<li>Code now supports persisting margin settings. Thanks to Krasimir 
	Stoychev for this update.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>27 July 2006</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Minor update to the sample app to fix an ASSERT related to the 
	formatting of the IDR_SCINTITYPE string resource. Thanks to Matt Spear for 
	reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.17 (17 September 2006)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated the CScintillaView::OnReplaceSel and CScintillaView::OnReplaceAll 
	implementations to use TargetFromSelection and ReplaceTargetRE/ReplaceTarget. 
	Thanks to Matt Spear for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in UTF82W (and W2UTF8) where if GetLine is called in a 
	Unicode build for the end of the file (i.e. a line having a length of 0), 
	the UTF82W function would allocate no buffer, but still erroneously write a 
	one character terminating null. In addition, the caller (GetLine) will try 
	to deallocate the buffer that was never allocated. Thanks to Scott Kelley 
	for spotting this nasty bug.</li>
	<li>Added of a GetLineEx method which explicitly sets the first WORD value 
	in the text string to the maximum size. This avoids client code from having 
	to deal with the weird semantics of the EM_GETLINE message. Thanks to Scott 
	Kelley for providing this
	nice addition.</li>
	<li>Verified code implements all the functionality of Scintilla v1.71</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.18 (11 June 2007)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Demo program included in the download is now compiled with VC 2005 SP1</li>
	<li>Addition of a SCINTILLADOCVIEW_EXT_CLASS preprocessor to allow the 
	classes to be more easily used in an extension DLL.</li>
	<li>Addition of a SCINTILLACTRL_EXT_CLASS preprocessor macro to allow the 
	classes to be more easily used in an extension DLL.</li>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>CScintillaCtrl::GetSelText now uses CString::GetBufferSetLength to avoid 
	having to allocate an intermediate buffer. Thanks to Jochen Neubeck for 
	reporting this optimization.</li>
	<li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.73. New messages wrapped 
	include: SCI_STYLEGETFORE, SCI_STYLEGETBACK, SCI_STYLEGETBOLD, 
	SCI_STYLEGETITALIC, SCI_STYLEGETSIZE, SCI_STYLEGETFONT, 
	SCI_STYLEGETEOLFILLED, SCI_STYLEGETUNDERLINE, SCI_STYLEGETCASE, 
	SCI_STYLEGETCHARACTERSET, SCI_STYLEGETVISIBLE, SCI_STYLEGETCHANGEABLE, 
	SCI_STYLEGETHOTSPOT, SCI_GETSELEOLFILLED, SCI_SETSELEOLFILLED, 
	SCI_GETHOTSPOTACTIVEFORE, SCI_GETHOTSPOTACTIVEBACK, 
	SCI_GETHOTSPOTACTIVEUNDERLINE &amp; SCI_GETHOTSPOTSINGLELINE</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.19 (28 November 2007)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.75. New messages wrapped 
	include: SCI_INDICSETUNDER, SCI_INDICGETUNDER, new behavior for 
	SCI_SETINDENTATIONGUIDES &amp; SCI_GETINDENTATIONGUIDES, 
	SCI_SETSCROLLWIDTHTRACKING, SCI_GETSCROLLWIDTHTRACKING, SCI_DELWORDRIGHTEND, 
	SCI_SETCARETSTYLE, SCI_GETCARETSTYLE, SCI_SETINDICATORCURRENT, 
	SCI_SETINDICATORVALUE, SCI_INDICATORFILLRANGE, SCI_INDICATORCLEARRANGE, 
	SCI_INDICATORALLONFOR, SCI_INDICATORVALUEAT, SCI_INDICATORSTART, 
	SCI_INDICATOREND, SCI_SETPOSITIONCACHE &amp; SCI_GETPOSITIONCACHE</li>
	<li>The auto completion sample in CScintillaDemoView::OnCharAdded has been 
	extended to show another style of auto completion. Thanks to alessandro 
	limonta for suggesting this update.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.20 (19 March 2008)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.76. New messages wrapped include: 
	SCI_COPYALLOWLINE.</li>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Updated code to clean compile on VC 2008.</li>
	<li>Removed VC 6 style classwizard comments from the code.</li>
	<li>Updated the sample app's document icon.</li>
	<li>Fixed a copy and paste bug in CScintillaView::PrintPage where the 
	incorrect margin value was being used in the calculation of &quot;rfPrint.rc.left&quot;. 
	Thanks to Steve Arnold for reporting this bug.</li>
	<li>Fixed a level 4 warning when the code is compiled on VC 6.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.21 (15 June 2008)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Code now compiles cleanly using Code Analysis (/analyze)</li>
	<li>Updated code to compile correctly using _ATL_CSTRING_EXPLICIT_CONSTRUCTORS 
	define</li>
	<li>The code now only supports VC 2005 or later.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.22 (1 November 2008)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated class to work with Scintilla v1.77. New messages wrapped 
	include: SCI_GETCHARACTERPOINTER, SCI_SETKEYSUNICODE &amp; SCI_GETKEYSUNICODE</li>
	<li>Reworked all the key Unicode functions which expose string length 
	management and reimplemented them to use CStringW output parameters. 
	Equivalent ASCII versions have also been provided. This new approach helps 
	to raise the level of abstraction provided by the wrapper class. In the 
	process the need for the GetLineEx function has been removed. Thanks to 
	Alexei Letov for prompting this update.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.23 (20 January 2009)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in CScintillaView::SameAsSelected where it did not correctly 
	handle the fact that GetSelectionStart() and GetSelectionEnd() returns the 
	positions in UTF-8 encoded text which would result in failures in the logic 
	for multibyte encoded characters. This made it impossible to replace 
	multibyte character sequences in find / replace operations. Thanks to Alexei 
	Letov for reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.24 (11 February 2009)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated the project file to remove VC 6 upgrade settings.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>30 April 2009</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated the project file to remove the now defunct manifest file. Thanks 
	to &quot;marshal&quot; for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.25 (3 October 2009)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	Fixed a bug in CScintillaCtrl::Create where a crash can occur in a 
	Unicode build if the CreateEx call fails (for example, if the Scintilla DLL 
	was not loaded). Thanks to Simon Smith for reporting this bug</li>
	<li>
	<p>Updated class to work with Scintilla v2.01. New messages wrapped 
	include: SCI_SETWRAPINDENTMODE, SCI_GETWRAPINDENTMODE, SCI_INDICSETALPHA, 
	SCI_INDICGETALPHA, SCI_SETEXTRAASCENT, SCI_GETEXTRAASCENT,
