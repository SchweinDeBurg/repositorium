<h2><a name="Features"></a><strong>Features</strong>


</h2>


<ul>
  <li>CTreeFileCtrl is derived from CTreeCtrl and
    can be created using the same mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Uses the system image list for the icons for
    folders and files. </li>
  <li>Can have multiple instances of the control
    active at one time.</li>
  <li>Optionally allows files to be displayed
    as well as folders.</li>
  <li>Integrates with the shell to allow the file
    to be <em>&quot;opened&quot;</em> and its properties page to be displayed.</li>
  <li>Provides for deletion and moving to the
    recycle bin. Message boxes used are the same as those provided in Windows Explorer.</li>
  <li>Supports drag &amp; drop and auto scrolling
    while dragging.</li>
  <li>Standard MFC DDX functions are provided to
    easily integrate with dialog based apps.</li>
  <li>Supports in place renaming of items.</li>
  <li>Provides a full set of keyboard accelerators
    similar to Windows Explorer.</li>
  <li>Unicode enabled and all code compiles
    cleanly at warning level 4.</li>
  <li>Can be used in a dialog resource or a CView derived
    class.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Usage"></a><strong>Usage</strong>

</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To use CTreeFileCtrl, include
    &quot;FileTreeCtrl.cpp / h&quot; in your project and
    #include &quot;FileTreeCtrl.h&quot; in the module you want to instantiate it in. You can
    use the usual MFC ways of hooking up the class. If you are using the class in a dialog
    resource, then you can use the DDX function provided. You can also create the control dynamically by calling its parent
    classes CTreeCtrl::Create method, in this case you will need to call the
    PopulateTree yourself to display the tree contents. To allow the control to
    allow in place editing of files / folders, just include the standard TVS_EDITLABELS
    tree control window style.</li>
  <li>You will also need to copy across the IDR_TREEFILECTRL_* 
  resources from either of the sample apps provided with the code.</li>
  <li>As of v1.39 you will need an up to date Platform SDK
    installed to compile the code if you are using Visual C++ 6 (February 2003 
	was the last version which was compatible with VC 6).</li>
  <li>Please note that you may have difficulties when using 
  the class in a CDialogBar derived class. As reported by Don Woodward: I put 
  one of these in my CDialogBar derived class and because of CControlBar's 
  WindowProc coupled with you doing this everywhere:<br>
  <br>
  return FALSE; //Allow the message to be reflected again<br>
  <br>
  things were going haywire.<br>
  ....<br>
  My solution was to do this in my CDialogBar class:<br>
  <br>
  LRESULT MyDialogBar::WindowProc(UINT nMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)<br>
  {<br>
&nbsp; if ((WM_NOTIFY == nMsg) &amp;&amp; (((NMHDR*)lParam)-&gt;idFrom == 
  IDC_MY_TREE_CONTROL_ID))<br>
&nbsp; { // a WM_NOTIFY coming from our tree control; use CWnd's WindowProc 
  cause CDialogBar's will dispatch to our tree control twice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return CWnd::WindowProc(nMsg, wParam, lParam);<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; return CDialogBar::WindowProc(nMsg, wParam, lParam);<br>
  }</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="History"></a><strong>History</strong></h2>

<p><strong>v1.0 (27 December 1999)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Initial public release.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.01 (12 January
2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Added some asserts to HasGotSubEntries.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem with calling OnDblclk when no tree item is selected.</li>
  <li>Removed an unused variable from SetSelectedPath.</li>
  <li>Fixed a stack overflow in CSortedArray::Sort.</li>
  <li>Now supports check boxes with each item in the tree
    control.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.02 (25 January 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Minor update to the code in CTreeFileCtrl::OnDblclk to only allow                          selected items to be opened.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.03 (31 January 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a problem when you right mouse click over a non - selected item.
    The control now implements the same behaviour as Explorer for this.</li>
  <li>Removed check for keyboard invocation of the context menu in OnContextMenu</li>
  <li>Now displays the context menu over the selected item when invoked via
    the keyboard. Again this is the same behaviour as Explorer has.</li>
  <li>Optimized the code in PreTranslateMessage.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in CTreeFileCtrl::OnEndlabeledit</li>
  <li>Some of the menus in the sample app have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Menu items have been added to the sample app to allow
    the SetAllow... functions to be tried out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.04 (21 February 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a number of problems in CSortedArray::Find</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.05 (22 February 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> Fixed a problem in CSortedArray::Find when there are no items in the array</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.06 (29 February 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> Fixed a problem in CSortedArray::Sort when there are no items in the array</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.07 (2 April 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a small bug in CTreeFileCtrl::SetRootFolder</li>
  <li>Fixed the problem with initialisation errors in the code. Client code must not                          explicitly call PopulateTree when the window is created. When used in a dialog
    resource this is not necessary as it is called for you in the DDX functions.</li>
  <li>Sample app now also include the control in the about
    box as an example.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.08 (13 May 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a problem where items on the context menu were being invoked for the
    wrong item when you right mouse click over an item that is not the selected item.
    Behaviour now is that the item is selected prior to showing the context menu.
    Now, this is same behaviour as Explorer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.09 (18 July 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Now uses ON_NOTIFY_REFLECT_EX instead of ON_NOTIFY_REFLECT for handling reflected
    messages. This allows derived classes to handle these messages also. Thanks to                          Christian Dahl for this.</li>
  <li>Sample app now allows drag drop behaviour to be toggled</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem whereby two items were left selected after you did a 
  drag /drop operation. Thanks to Jonathon Ralston for this.</li>
  <li>Removed function declaration for unused function &quot;InsertDriveItem&quot;.</li>
  <li>Removed an unreferenced variable in InsertFileItem.</li>
  <li>Tidied up the UpOneLevel functions and made it public.</li>
  <li>Removed all the message handlers in the sample code which reflect straight
    down to the tree control. Instead the OnCmdMsg first routes the message to this
    class.</li>
  <li>Renamed all menu items which CTreeFileCtrl uses to include the prefix TREEFILECTRL</li>
  <li>Renamed all the methods to more generic names&nbsp;</li>
  <li>PreTranslateMessage now uses PostMessage instead of calling functions directly.                          This allows up to function correctly for derived classes in addition to correctly
    disabling items through the OnUpdate mechanism</li>
  <li>Removed an unreferenced variable in OnRclick</li>
  <li>Removed the unreferenced variable m_hSelItem</li>
  <li>Optimized a number of expressions by putting the boolean comparisons first</li>
  <li>m_bAllowRename parameter is now observed for in place editing of an item</li>
  <li>Now supports hiding of Drive types via the SetDriveHideFlags function. See the                          menu options on the Tools menu in the sample program for its usage.</li>
  <li>Filename masks can now be specified via the SetFileNameMask method. See the                          menu options on the Tools menu in the sample program for its usage.</li>
  <li>File types can now be specified via the GetFileHideFlags function. See the                          menu options on the Tools menu in the sample program for its usage.</li>
  <li>Fixed a small issue in one of my calls to ::GetKeyState</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where programs was crashing if an icon index for it could not
    be found.</li>
  <li>Made many of the methods of CTreeFileCtrl virtual, thus allowable better
    use in end user derived classes.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem where SetSelectedPath(_T("C:\\"), FALSE) was resulting                          in the drive being expanded even through FALSE was being sent in to specify
    that the item should not be expanded.</li>
  <li>A virtual "CanDisplayFile" has been added to allow you to decide at runtime
    whether or not a certain file is to be displayed.</li>
  <li>A virtual "CanDisplayFolder" has been added to allow you to decide at
    runtime whether or not a certain folder is to be displayed&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Now optionally displays compressed files in a different 
  Colour, 
  similar to
    explorer. The Colour is customizable through the class API.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Code has been made smarter so that it does not have to spin up the floppy
    disk to determine if there are files on it. It now initially displays a "+" and only when you try to expand it will it do the actual scan.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.10 (24 July 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the expansion state of the selected item was not being
    preserved across refreshes.</li>
  <li>Now includes full support for Next / Prev support 
  similar to Windows                          Explorer with the Desktop Update.</li>
  <li>Updated sample app to have some useful toolbars.</li>
  <li>Changing any tree settings which can affect its appearance now force
    a refresh of its contents.</li>
  <li>ItemToPath method has been made const.</li>
  <li>Addition of PathToItem method</li>
  <li>Auto refresh of items is now provided for by means of change notification
    threads. This is configurable via the SetAutoRefresh method.</li>
  <li>The root folder of the tree control can now be changed from the sample app</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in SetRootFolder when passed an empty folder</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the system image list was not being initialized correctly
    if the user did not have a "C:\\" drive. This could occur on NT/Windows2000</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in IsFile and IsFolder which was causing invalid files or folders
    to appear valid.</li>
  <li>Deleted items are now removed upon expansion. Also if the item being expanded was
    deleted and it was the only child, then its parent has the "-" expansion button removed</li>
  <li>Removable drive nodes are collapsed back to their root nodes if their media is                          changed in the intervening time when a node expansion occurs.</li>
  <li>Wait cursor is now displayed while a refresh is taking place.</li>
  <li>A "OnSelectionChanged" virtual function has now been provided&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sample app's icon has been made the same as Explorers.</li>
  <li>Sample app now displays the path name of the currently selected item in the tree control.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in IsCompressed</li>
  <li>items are now deleted when selected if they do not exist.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.11 (27 August 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed another stack overflow problem in
    CSortedArray::Sort.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem in CSortedArray::Sort where the comparison function
    was returning negative values, 0 and positive values instead of -1, 0 &amp; 1.
    Thanks to Ted Crow for finding both of these problems.</li>
  <li>Updated the documentation for SetCompareFunction on
    what values are expected to be returned from it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.12 (5 September 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in CTreeFileCtrl::IsFile and CTreeFileCtrl::IsFolder</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.13 (20 September 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> Control now includes DECLARE_DYNCREATE thereby allowing it to be used
    in code which requires this such as Stingray's SEC3DTabWnd. Thanks to Petter Nilsen for
    pointing out this omission.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.14 (2 October 2000)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a stack overwrite problem in CSystemImageList::CSystemImageList.</li>
  <li>Removed an unreferenced variable in CTreeFileCtrl::OnSelChanged</li>
  <li>Removed an unreferenced variable in CTreeFileCtrl::OnItemExpanding</li>
  <li>Changed the SendMessage in CTreeFileCtrl::OnDblClk to prevent a crash
    which was occurring when the open call sometimes caused a refresh call                          which changed the tree items at times. When the double click message handler
    continued it then caused item expand notifications for items already deleted
    and of course crashes.</li>
  <li>Removed an unreferenced variable in CTreeFileCtrl::EndDragging6. Removed an 
  unreferenced variable in CTreeFileCtrl::KillNotificationThread</li>
  <li>Sample app now remembers the selected path and its expansion state across
    invocations.  Thanks to Mike Funduc for finding
    all these problems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.15 (5 May 2001)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Updated copyright message.</li>
  <li>Fixed a resource leak where icon resources were not being released. Thanks to Jay Kohler for
    spotting this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.2 (5 August 2001)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> You can now optionally display Network Neighborhood</li>
  <li>You can now turn on / off display of file extensions.</li>
  <li>You can now display shared items with a different icon</li>
  <li>Friendly names can now be displayed for drives.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.21 (11 August 2001)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> Improved checking to see if action is allowed in Rename and Delete</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in OnBeginLabelEdit</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem in OnEndLabelEdit which was causing renames to fail when filename extensions                          were not being shown.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.22 (11 August 2001)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in OnSelChanged which was causing a crash when you right click on an empty area of the control.
    Thanks to Eli Fenton for spotting this one.</li>
  <li>The control now by default shows drives as children of "My Computer" just like in Explorer.</li>
  <li>When you display a rooted directory in the control, you now have the option of displaying the root
    folder in the control as the root item.  Thanks to Eli Fenton for suggesting this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.23 (1 October 2001)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed another bug in CSortedArray::Sort!. Thanks to Jim Johnson for spotting this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.24 (26 October 2001)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> Fixed some stability problems with the code. This was due to adding items to the system image list.
    This is normally a very bad thing. Instead now the code uses TreeView custom draw (just like the blue 
  colour
    for compressed items) to draw the icons for the Network Neighborhood items. Thanks to Darken Screamer and
    Timo Haberkern for spotting this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.25 (24 December 2001)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a copy and paste bug in GoForward. Thanks to Michael T. Luongo for this fix.</li>
  <li>Now allows encrypted files to be displayed in a different 
  colour</li>
  <li>Fixed memory leak which was occurring when control was being used in a dialog</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem with the calculation of indents when the style "TVS_LINESATROOT" is used.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.26 (16 February 2002)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Updated copyright message</li>
  <li>Fixed a drag/drop problem which caused the tree state to be inconsistent after the file was dropped.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the refresh code which was causing it to not reselect the selected node
    after the refresh occurs. Thanks to John Noël for this fix.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem where the custom draw icons for network nodes were not being drawn in the correct
    positions when scrollbars were present in the control. Again thanks to John Noël for this fix.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in SetSelectedPath which would not display the correct selection if the node we                          want to select has been deleted due to the node becoming deleted when it was previously collapsed.
    Thanks to Franz Fackelmann and John Noël for spotting this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.27 of CSortedArray (29 May 2002)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> Fixed a problem in CSortedArray::OrderedInsert. Thanks to John Young
    for spotting and fixing this problem.</li>
  <li>Updated copyright and usage instructions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.27 of CTreeFileCtrl (5 June 2002)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Implemented function "SetUsingDifferentColorForEncrypted" which was declared but had no
    implementation.</li>
  <li>Fixed report of uninitialized member variable "m_nTimerID". Thanks to Emil Isberg for 
  spotting this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7 August 2002</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed a bug in the sample app which ships with the class which was 
  occurring when you compiled
    the code in Visual Studio.Net. This was due to MS changing the location oleimpl2.h header file. Thanks
    to Darren Schroeder for spotting this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>28 August 2002</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Updated sample app to automatically refresh upon
    removal or addition of removal disk drives. Thanks to &quot;kimo&quot; for
    this update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.28 of CTreeFileCtrl (22 September 2002)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li> Removed a number of unreferenced variables from the code, as highlighted by Visual Studio.Net. Thanks
    to Bill Johnson for spotting this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.28 of CSortedArray (6 December 2002)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Rewrote the Sort method following reports of further 
  problems by Serhiy Pavlov and Brian Rhodes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.29 of CSortedArray (11 December 2002)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Optimized code by replacing all calls to CArray&lt;&gt;::ElementAt 
  with CArray&lt;&gt;::GetData</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.29 of CFileTreeCtrl (31 December 2002)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Items are now sorted using the TVM_SORTCHILDRENCB Tree 
  Control message. This means that the class is no longer dependent on the 
  CSortedArray class. That class has been left in this download for convenience 
  only. Thanks to &quot;Vladi&quot; for this suggestion. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.30 of CSortedArray (24 January 2003)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Made CSortedArray::Find method const. Thanks to Serhiy 
  Pavlov for reporting this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.30 of CFileTreeCtrl (26 February 2003)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in CTreeFileCtrl::PathToItem which was 
  causing refreshes to fail when a rooted folder was being displayed. Thanks to 
  Michael J. Ryan for spotting this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.31 of CFileTreeCtrl (27 February 2003)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed more problems with refreshing and rooted paths. 
  Thanks to Michael J. Ryan for spotting this.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.32 of CFileTreeCtrl (31 May 2003)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the filename mask was being ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.33 of CFileTreeCtrl (10 June 2003)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Custom draw is now not used for items underneath Network Neighborhood. This means that some items there will just display the standard 
  network neighborhood icon. To resolve this issue you would need to implement a 
  completely new solution using the shell API's. Thanks to John Noël for 
  reporting a custom draw bug in this area which has forced this change.</li>
  <li>m_sFQPath is now not filled in for virtual items such 
  as My Computer and Network Neighborhood. Thanks to Hans Dietrich for this 
  suggestion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.34 of CFileTreeCtrl (5 July 2003)</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Updated the WM_DEVICECHANGE message handler in the 
  sample app to use the correct function signature for Visual Studio 6 and 
  later. Thanks to Ed Eichman for reporting this issue.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the documentation of 
  CTreeFileCtrl::SetDriveHideFlags. Thanks to Ed Eichman for reporting this 
  issue.</li>
  <li>Now documents the functions SetAutoRefresh and 
  GetAutoRefresh. In addition by default auto refresh is now turned off. Thanks 
  to Ed Eichman for pointing this out.</li>
  <li>Move sample workspace up to VC 6.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>18 August 2003</strong><ul>
  <li> Removed CSortedArray from the download as it is 
  available as a separate download now.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5 October 2003</strong><ul>
  <li> Updated the Usage section of the documentation to 
  describe an issue you may encounter when you use the class in a CDialogBar 
  derived class.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>24 October 2003</strong><ul>
  <li> Updated the Usage section of the documentation to 
  describe the need to copy across the appropriate resources from the sample 
  app.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.35 of CTreeFileCtrl (9 July 2004)</strong><ul>
  <li>Fixed a memory leak in the NETRESOURCE structure if 
  client code returned FALSE from CTreeFileCtrl::CanDisplayNetworkItem. Thanks 
  to Michael Oerder reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.36 of CTreeFileCtrl (17 April 2005)</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Addition of TVIF_HANDLE to the mask fields in the functions GetIconIndex(HTREEITEM hItem),                          GetSelIconIndex(HTREEITEM hItem) and SetHasPlusButton(HTREEITEM hItem, BOOL bHavePlus). This avoids ASSERTs
    when the class is derived from the SECTreeCtrl class in the Stingray Objective Toolkit. Thanks to Greg Marr
    for reporting this problem.</li>
  <li>Addition of a "FILETREECTRL_EXT_CLASS" define to the class defintions. This makes the code easier to use
    in an extension DLL.</li>
  <li>Code now uses the TVITEM structure name rather than TV_ITEM which is in line with what is recommended by MS.</li>
  <li>Code now uses the TVINSERTSTRUCT structure name rather than TV_INSERTSTRUCT which is in line with what is                          recommended by MS.</li>
  <li>Class now uses a preprocessor define of FILETREECTRL_BASE_CLASS to define the class which CTreeFileCtrl
    is derived from. This allows the class to be used with the Stingray Objective Toolkit without needing to                          modify the CTreeFileCtrl source code.</li>
  <li>Optimized the code which deletes child nodes by now using TVE_COLLAPSERESET flag.</li>
  <li>Removed the unused function NumberOfChildItems.</li>
  <li>Code now uses the NMTREEVIEW structure name rather than NM_TREEVIEW which is in line with what is                          recommended by MS.</li>
  <li>Removed the now unused DeleteChildren method.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.37 of CTreeFileCtrl (21 June 2005)</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed a bug where drag and drag mechanism had problems when trying to drag an item into a folder immediately
    after the root item. Thanks to Larry Paul for reporting this bug and provinding the fix.</li>
  <li> Fixed a number of compiler warnings when the code is compiled using Visual Studio .NET 2003.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.38 of CTreeFileCtrl (25 January 2006)</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Updated the documentation to use the new style which the web site uses.</li>
	<li> Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li> Removed the GetChecked / SetChecked methods as CTreeCtrl as of VC++ 6 
	includes equivalent functionality. </li>
	<li> The CanDisplayFolder method has been updated to use logic similar to 
	the CanDisplayFile virtual function. This new functionality is controlled by a new m_dwFolderHideFlags 
	variable which can be modified via the functions SetFolderHideFlags &amp; 
	GetFolderHideFlags. Thanks to Bob O'Neil for this update.</li>
	<li> Reviewed all TRACE statements for correctness.</li>
	<li> Fixed an issue where you get an ASSERT in the code when you are using 
	XP manifest support and you are using the TVS_CHECKBOXES style in your 
	CTreeFileCtrl. The issue seems to be a bug in Commctrl v6 custom draw
	notifications as this problem does not occur if you are not using XP themes. 
	Thanks to Bob O'Neill for this update.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.39 of CTreeFileCtrl (18 June 2006)</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Replaced all calls to ZeroMemory with memset</li>
	<li> Replaced all calls to CopyMemory with memcpy</li>
	<li> Optimized CTreeFileCtrlItemInfo constructor code</li>
	<li> Now includes code to optionally show &quot;Desktop&quot; as the root node. Thanks 
	to Hans Dietrich for this very nice addition</li>
	<li> Removed some now deleted files from the project.</li>
	<li> Fixed a minor typo in the Allow Properties menu item in the sample app.</li>
	<li> Now includes code to optionally show &quot;My Documents&quot;. Thanks to Hans 
	Dietrich for this very nice addition.</li>
	<li> Fixed bug where m_bExtensionHidden setting was not being copied in 
	CTreeFileCtrlItemInfo constructor.</li>
	<li> Renamed SetDisplayNetwork to SetShowNetwork and GetDisplayNetwork to 
	GetShowNetwork for consistency with all the other functions of the same 
	type.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>19 June 2006</strong><ul>
  <li> Updated the usage section to explain that the code now requires the 
	Platform SDK to be installed if you are compiling the code with VC 6.</li>
	<li> Added a missing manifest file to the zip download.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.40 of CTreeFileCtrl (22 June 2006)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where expansion of the Desktop node fails on subsequent 
	expansions. Thanks to Jan Moorman for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.41 of CTreeFileCtrl (1 July 2006)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where expansion of UNC folders failed. Thanks to Jan Moorman 
	for reporting this bug.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>v1.42 of CTreeFileCtrl (1 July 2006)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the code to clean compile on VC 2005 </li>
	<li>Code now uses new C++ style casts rather than old style C casts where 
	necessary.</li>
</ul>
