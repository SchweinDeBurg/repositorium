<h2 align="left">CTreeOptionsCtrl v1.72</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>CTreeOptionsCtrl</strong>, a control which implements a tree 
options control similar to the advanced tab as seen on the &quot;Internet Options&quot; dialog 
in Internet Explorer 4 and later. In addition to Boolean values, it also allows 
edit boxes, combo boxes, file browser, folder browsers, color browsers, font browsers, 
font name combo boxes, general opaque objects, date controls, time controls and 
IP address controls to be included in the tree control, similar to the new printer 
property dialogs which were introduced in Windows 2000. Included below is a snapshot showing 
the demo application and what the control looks like. </p>

<h2><a name="Features"></a>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Derived from the MFC class CTreeCtrl so if you have used this class before, 
	then you should get up to speed using the CTreeOptionsCtrl pretty easily.</li>
	<li>Items supported included check boxes, radio buttons, semi check boxes, edit 
	boxes, combo boxes (drop list and editable), Edit boxes with spin control, File 
	browser, Folder browser, Color selector, Font selector, Font Name selector and 
	Boolean selector &lt;g&gt;!.</li>
	<li>Code is UNICODE enabled and build configurations are provided.</li>
	<li>All widget classes (e.g. Combo boxes and edit boxes) that are created can 
	be customized without affected the base code.</li>
	<li>All code compiles cleanly at level 4.</li>
	<li>Small footprint, total size amounts to just c. 2400 lines of code, for such 
	a large amount of functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Usage"></a>Usage</h2>
<ul>
	<li>To use the class in your code simply include TreeOptionsCtrl.cpp in your 
	project and #include &quot;TreeOptionsCtrl.h&quot; in which ever of your modules needs 
	to make calls to the class.</li>
	<li>You also need to copy over the strings from the sample apps string table 
	(IDS_TREEOPTIONS_...)</li>
	<li>Your code will need to include MFC either statically or dynamically.</li>
	<li>As of v1.70, the classes are now designed for VC 2005 or later. 
	They will not compile on earlier releases of VC.</li>
	<li>To see the class in action, have a look at the usage of the code in the 
	module &quot;appDlg.cpp&quot;.</li>
	<li>Please note that the functions SetItemData and GetItemData which the class 
	inherits from CTreeCtrl can no longer be used safely since CTreeOptionsCtrl 
	use the item data for internally allocated data. All usage of GetItemData should 
	be replaced by usage of GetUserItemData and SetUserItemData instead.</li>
	<li>Please note that by default the descriptive text you display for an item 
	should not include the text &quot;: &quot;. This is because this text is used as the divider 
	between the descriptive text and the actual data to be edited. You can change 
	this using the &quot;SetTextSeparator&quot; method.</li>
	<li>You should ensure that you hook up an image list to the control via SetImageList 
	(even if you don&#39;t intend for your items to have icons). This is because the 
	classes uses the space allocated for the image list icon as the place to put 
	the custom draw bitmaps.</li>
</ul>

	button items.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.11 (5 October 1999)</strong> </p>

	<li>Made class more self contained by internally managing the image list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.2 (8 October 1999)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for including combo boxes as well as edit boxes into the edit 
	control.</li>
	<li>Added support for customizing the image list to use</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.21 (29 February 2000)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Removed a VC 6 level 4 warning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.22 (3 April 2000)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for navigation into and out of the combo boxes and edit controls 
	inside the control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.23 (10 May 2000)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the text was not being transferred to the control when 
	the in place combo or edit box is active and the tree control gets destroyed.</li>
	<li>Added support for having check box items as children of other check box 
	items</li>
	<li>Setting the check box state of a parent now also sets the check box state 
	for all child box children.</li>
	<li>Setting the check box state affects the check box state of the parent if 
	that parent is also a check box.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.24 (30 May 2000)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Code now uses ON_NOTIFY_REFLECT_EX instead of ON_NOTIFY_REFLECT. This allows 
	derived classes to handle the reflected messages also.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.25 (3 July 2000)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Now includes support for edit boxes with accompanying spin controls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.26 (25 April 2001)</strong> </p>

	<li>Added an option which determines if check box state should be changed when 
	you click anywhere on an item or just over the checkbox icon</li>
	<li>Updated copyright message</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.30 (12 August 2001)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue in GetComboText and GetEditText where the code was modifying 
	the contents of the combo/edit box when it was being read. This was because 
	that function is doing double duty as it is called when the child control is 
	about to be created in place, and you want to remove the text from the tree 
	control and put it in the child control. Thanks to &quot;Jef&quot; for spotting this.</li>
	<li>Made the code in SetComboText more robust. Thanks to &quot;Jef&quot; for this also.</li>
	<li>Added a DDX method for integers in a edit box. Thanks to Colin Urquhart 
	for this.</li>
	<li>Added a extra member to _TreeOptionsItemData to be used as an item data. 
	This allows you to avoid having to implement multiple derived classes and instead 
	use the item data to stash away pointers etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.31 (27 August 2001)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Provided a &quot;GetUserItemData&quot; member to provide access to the item data provided 
	by the class. Thanks to Colin Urquhart for this.</li>
	<li>Fixed a redraw problem which occurred when you scrolled using an wheel enabled 
	mouse. Thanks to &quot;Jef&quot; for spotting this.</li>
	<li>Provided an AutoSelect option which automatically sets focus to child control 
	in the tree control. Thanks to &quot;Jef&quot; for this suggestion.</li>
	<li>Added full support for CBS_DROPDOWN and CBS_SIMPLE style combo boxes. Thanks 
	to &quot;Jef&quot; for this suggestion.</li>

	<li>Provided support for specifying a Boolean value from a combo box.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.41 (27 November 2001)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the message map for OnMouseWheel was setup incorrectly. 
	It should have been ON_WM_MOUSEWHEEL instead of ON_MESSAGE!!!.</li>
	<li>Allowed passing in the hAfter item for the InsertItem calls. All params 
	are defaulted as to not affect any current code.</li>
	<li>Made possible the use of radio button groups followed by other items (in 
	which case the group is considered complete).</li>
	<li>Added a couple of utility functions at the bottom of the cpp file. Thanks 
	to Mike Funduc for all these updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.42 (5 December 2001)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Minor code tidy up following development of the author&#39;s CListOptionsCtrl 
	class</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.43 (13 December 2001)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an assertion in OnClick. Thanks to &quot;flipposwitch&quot; for spotting the 
	problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.44 (14 February 2002)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Now allows item data to be associated with any item added to the control.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with return value from GetUserItemData.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.45 (2 June 2002)</strong></p>
<ul>

	tree control is expanded or contracted. Thanks to Lauri Ott for spotting this 
	problem.</li>
	<li>Now fully supports the CDateTimeCtrl for editing of dates and times</li>
	<li>Now fully supports the CIPAddressCtrl for editing of IP addresses</li>
	<li>Custom draw support for color browser items is now configurable via an additional 
	parameter of the AddColorBrowser method</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.46 (24 September 2002)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated documentation which incorrectly stated that the parent of a check 
	box item must be a group item as inserted with InsertGroup. Thanks to Kögl Christoph 
	for spotting this.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with &quot;IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC(CDateTimeCtrl...&quot; not being declared 
	properly. Some users reported that it worked ok, while others said that my fix 
	was causing link problems. The problem should be sorted out for good now. Thanks 
	to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.</li>
	<li>Renamed the SetImageListToUse function to &quot;SetImageListResourceIDToUse&quot;.</li>
	<li>Provided a GetImageListResourceIDToUse function to match up with the Set 
	function.</li>
	<li>Provided a method to allow the user item data to be changed after an item 
	has been created.</li>
	<li>Provided some documentation info on how to safely use item data in the control. 
	Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.</li>
	<li>Fixed a potential memory leak in AddComboBox if the function is invoked 
	twice without an explicit delete of the item first. Thanks to Kögl Christoph 
	for reporting this.</li>
	<li>Fixed some typos in the documentation. It incorrectly stated that the return 
	type of member functions InsertGroup, InsertCheckBox, and InsertRadioButton 
	is BOOL when in fact it is HTREEITEM.&nbsp; Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting 
	this.</li>
	<li>Improved the look of the disabled checked check button. Thanks to Kögl Christoph 
	for reporting this.</li>
	<li>Improved the look of the disabled radio button which is selected. Thanks 
	to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.47 (17 October 2002)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Added a method to add an &quot;Opaque Browser&quot; to the Tree options control. An 
	Opaque Browser is where the tree options control allows a end user specified 
	structure to be edited by the tree options control without it explicitly knowing 
	what it is editing. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.48 (25 October 2002)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the download to include the missing files OpaqueShow.cpp/h. Thanks 
	to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.</li>
	<li>Made the class more const-correct. e.g. the Get... member functions are 
	now const. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this. Also updated the documentation 
	for this.</li>
	<li>Updated the documentation to refer to the &quot;Opaque Browser&quot; support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.49 (28 October 2002)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where upon a combo losing focus it will also result in the associated 
	button control would also be destroyed. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting 
	this problem. Fixed this bug should also fix an intermittent release bug which 
	was occurring in this area.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.50 (30 October 2002)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Made a number of other methods const. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting 
	this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.51 (15 November 2002)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Now allows the Field Data separator i.e. &quot;: &quot; to be configured. Please note 
	that the characters you pick should be avoided in the descriptive text you display 
	for an item as it is used as the divider between the descriptive text and the 
	actual data to be edited. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for this update.</li>
	<li>Fixed an access violation in CTreeOptionsCtrl::OnSelchanged when there is 
	no selected item in the control. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for this update.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.52 (6 February 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a memory leak which can occur when the control is used in a property 
	sheet. Thanks to David Rainey for reporting this problem.</li>
	<li>Fixed another memory leak in the destructor of the CTreeOptionsCtrl class 
	when the test app is closed.</li>
	<li>Did a spell check on the documentation &lt;g&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.53 (14 May 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the OnSelChanged function was getting in the way when 
	the control was being cleared down, leading to an ASSERT. Thanks to Chen Fu 
	for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.54 (7 June 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the date time control was not reflecting the changes when 
	the child control was displayed. Thanks to Tom Serface for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.55 (17 July 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Made SetRadioButton methods in CTreeOptionsCtrl virtual to allow further 
	client customisation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.56 (26 July 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix an issue where the child controls get drawn in the wrong place, if the 
	item is just on the vertical (either top or bottom) edge of the client area. 
	Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this problem and providing the fix.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.6 (31 July 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Now class does not require the use of the built in image list. This means 
	that now the class behaves like its parent class CTreeCtrl in that management 
	of the image list is entirely outside of the class and client code calls SetImageList 
	as per normal.</li>
	<li>Class now draws the radio and check box icons using custom draw.</li>
	<li>Class now takes advantage of XP Visual Themes when available.</li>
	<li>Made a number of additional functions virtual to allow more types of client 
	customisation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.61 (2 August 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Now supports multi-line edit controls as a child control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.62 (18 September 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug when the control draws the custom draw icons when the control 
	does not have an image list attached. Thanks to Benoit Lariviere for reporting 
	this problem.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the control draws the custom draw icons in the wrong position 
	when the control has horizontal scroll bars. Thanks to Benoit Lariviere for 
	reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20 September 2003</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated documentation to better explain how to use the class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.63 (11 December 2003)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented the function SetUseThemes which was missing. Thanks to Marcel 
	Scherpenisse for reporting this problem. Also updated the sample app to enable 
	toggling of this setting. </li>
	<li>Improved the default look of radio buttons and check boxes when the control 
	is not XP themed. This is achieved using the virtual function GetItemIconPosition. 
	Thanks to Marcel Scherpenisse for reporting this issue. This update also means 
	that by default radio buttons and check boxes are by default draw as 16*16 icons 
	centred in the icon position for each item. This can of course by overridden 
	by derived classes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.64 (5 February 2004)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Made HandleChildControlLosingFocus public so that it can be called from 
	outside the class. This is useful in the following scenario reported by RnySmile: 
	I noticed a bug happened only if it is used in a Property Page. I added an Edit 
	item, and when user leaves that item with a child control active while tabbing 
	away to another tab, the data of that item will lost. The solution is to ensure 
	HandleChildControlLosingFocus is called before a DDX_Tree... function is called 
	if a child control is active.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.65 (5 May 2004)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some compiler warnings when the code is compiled using VC 7.x. Please 
	note that to implement these fixes, the code will now require the Platform SDK 
	to be installed if you compile the code on VC 6.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.66 (26 January 2005)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Both of the sample apps shipped with the class now include XP manifest files, 
	meaning that the full look and feel of XP Themes are shown. Thanks to Piotr 
	Zagawa for reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.67 (16 March 2005)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for crash when you have one of the edit controls in a IP address control 
	selected and you then select another item in the tree options control. Hard 
	to know if this is a bug in the control on in Windows itself. Either way, the 
	workaround fix is to ensure that the child windows of an IP Address control 
	are destroyed before we destroy the IP address control itself. Thanks to Steve 
	Hayes for reporting this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.68 (11 July 2006)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details</li>
	<li>Removed unused constructor and destructor methods from some of the classes 
	in the sample app.</li>
	<li>Replaced calls to ZeroMemory with memset</li>
	<li>Addition of CTREEOPTIONSCTRL_EXT_CLASS macro to allow the code to be easily 
	added to an extension dll.</li>

	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsCtrl constructor code.</li>
	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsCombo constructor code.</li>
	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsDateCtrl constructor code </li>
	<li>Reworked CTreeOptionsDateCtrl::GetDisplayText logic</li>
	<li>Reworked CTreeOptionsTimeCtrl::GetDisplayText logic</li>
	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsIPAddressCtrl constructor code</li>
	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsEdit constructor code</li>
	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsSpinCtrl constructor code</li>
	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsBrowseButton constructor code</li>
	<li>Replaced calls to CopyMemory with memcpy</li>
	<li>Optimized CMultiLineEditFrameWnd constructor code</li>
	<li>Removed common control 6 manifest as this conflicts with VC 2005 compilation.</li>
	<li>Updated the code to clean compile on VC 2005.</li>
	<li>Updated documentation to use the same style as the web site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.69 (23 December 2007)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Removed VC 6 style AppWizard comments from the code.</li>
	<li>Optimized CTreeOptionsItemData constructor code</li>
	<li>Boolean member variables of CTreeOptionsItemData have now been made &quot;bool&quot; 
	instead of &quot;BOOL&quot;.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where if you create a combo box with a style of 
	CBS_DROPDOWN instead of CBS_DROPDOWNLIST, then the combo box would not be 
	properly deactivated when it loses focus to a control outside of the 
	TreeOptionsCtrl while the cursor is in the combo box edit field. Thanks to 
	Tobias Wolf for reporting this issue.</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash where you select a combo box item, select something in it 
	and then hit tab.</li>
	<li>Focus is now correctly transferred to a tree options button if you hit 
	tab on a tree options combo box.</li>
	<li>GetBrowseForFolderCaption, GetBrowseForFileCaption and 
	GetFileExtensionFilter all now by default use a string resource.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.70 (21 June 2008)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details</li>
	<li>Code now compiles cleanly using Code Analysis (/analyze)</li>
	<li>Updated code to compile correctly using _ATL_CSTRING_EXPLICIT_CONSTRUCTORS 
	define</li>
	<li>The code now only supports VC 2005 or later. </li>
	<li>Replaced all calls to CopyMemory with memcpy</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the CTreeOptionsCtrl constructor when checking the 
	validity of the function pointers for XP Theming.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the sample app's COpaqueShoeButton2::BrowseForOpaque 
	function</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.71 (20 July 2008)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Added two missing files to the download zip file specifically the 
	correct sln and vcproj files. Thanks to Ingmar Koecher for reporting this 
	issue.</li>
	<li>Radio buttons and check boxes now by default use a more 3d style of 
	drawing when XP theming is not active. You can revert back to a more flat 
	style of drawing these items by SetFlatStyleRadioButtons(TRUE) and 
	SetFlatStyleCheckBoxes(TRUE) respectively. Thanks to Ingmar Koecher for 
	reporting this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V1.72 (29 April 2012)</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details. </li>
	<li>Updated sample project settings to more modern defaults </li>
	<li>Code now compiles cleanly using Code Analysis (/analyze) </li>
	<li>When the parent node of a group of checkboxes is also a checkbox 
	(e.g. the Node &quot;Security&quot; in the test app) the parent is checked / unchecked 
	depending on the status of its children whenever a child is modified in the 
	GUI. This previously worked ok when you changed the checkmark of a child in 
	the GUI by mouse or keyboard, but it doesn't work if the change is made 
	programmatically (via SetCheckBox or by means of the referenced boolean 
	variable). The code has now been updated to handle this anomaly. Thanks to 
	Michael Oerder for providing this nice update. </li>

<strong>
<p><strong>Return Value</strong></p>
</strong>
<p>The group item&#39;s tree identifier.</p>
<strong>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>
</strong>
<p><em>lpszItem</em> The text of the item to add.</p>
<p><em>nImage</em> The zero based index of the icon in the tree controls image list 
to use for this group item.</p>
<p><em>hParent</em> Handle of the parent where the item should be inserted.</p>
<p><i>hAfter </i>The item to insert this item after.</p>
<p><i>dwItemData</i> The custom item data you want to use with this tree item. This 
can be used for whatever you want e.g. to maintain a pointer to a custom structure.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</p>
</strong>
<p>Adds a group item to the tree control. A group item is the parent of either a 
collection of radio items or check items. In the sample app, the two items which 
are group items are &quot;Accessibility (Example of check options)&quot; and &quot;When Searching 
(Example of radio options)&quot;. The first 8 icons of the image list associated with 
the tree options control are reserved and you should specify a <em>&quot;nImage&quot;</em> 
value greater than 7 when adding a group item. By default the function will add 
items at the root level of the tree control but you can add them at any depth using 
the <em>&quot;hParent&quot;</em> parameter. You can see this in the &quot;Internet options&quot; dialog 
which the control emulates.</p>
